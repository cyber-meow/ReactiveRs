//! A continuation represents some work to be done in the future.
//!
//! Continuations are also what are stored in the runtime(s) and to execute a
//! continuation we need to call it with some value. This construction is quite
//! similar to the one used by ReactiveML according to 
//! [this article](http://rml.lri.fr/publications/MandelPasteurPouzet-PPDP-2015.pdf).
